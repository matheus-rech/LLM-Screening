          abstract: "Intracranial pressure monitoring (ICP) is based on the doctrine proposed by Monroe and Kellie centuries ago. With the advancement of technology and science, various invasive and non-invasive modalities of monitoring ICP continue to be developed. An ideal monitor to track ICP should be easy to use, accurate, reliable, reproducible, inexpensive and should not be associated with infection or haemorrhagic complications. Although the transducers connected to the extra ventricular drainage continue to be Gold Standard, its association with the likelihood of infection and haemorrhage have led to the search for alternate non-invasive methods of monitoring ICP. While Camino transducers, Strain gauge micro transducer based ICP monitoring devices and the Spiegelberg ICP monitor are the emerging technology in invasive ICP monitoring, optic nerve sheath diameter measurement, venous opthalmodynamometry, tympanic membrane displacement, tissue resonance analysis, tonometry, acoustoelasticity, distortion-product oto-acoustic emissions, trans cranial doppler, electro encephalogram, near infra-red spectroscopy, pupillometry, anterior fontanelle pressure monitoring, skull elasticity, jugular bulb monitoring, visual evoked response and radiological based assessment of ICP are the non-invasive methods which are assessed against the gold standard.",

          abstract: "Aneurysmal subarachnoid hemorrhage is a medical condition that can lead to intracranial hypertension, negatively impacting patients' outcomes. This review article explores the underlying pathophysiology that causes increased intracranial pressure (ICP) during hospitalization. Hydrocephalus, brain swelling, and intracranial hematoma could produce an ICP rise. Although cerebrospinal fluid withdrawal via an external ventricular drain is commonly used, ICP monitoring is not always consistently practiced. Indications for ICP monitoring include neurological deterioration, hydrocephalus, brain swelling, intracranial masses, and the need for cerebrospinal fluid drainage. This review emphasizes the importance of ICP monitoring and presents findings from the Synapse-ICU study, which supports a correlation between ICP monitoring and treatment with better patient outcomes. The review also discusses various therapeutic strategies for managing increased ICP and identifies potential areas for future research.",

While EVDs are life-saving devices, they are associated with significant complications including infection, hemorrhage, and mechanical failure. This review examines the current evidence for EVD management protocols, infection prevention strategies, and complication rates. Proper insertion technique, sterile maintenance, and systematic monitoring protocols are essential for minimizing complications and optimizing patient outcomes. The management of EVDs requires careful attention to positioning, drainage parameters, and infection control measures.",
